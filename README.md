# stream-eet

This is a streaming application built with React that allows you to create an account with Google Oauth. You can view all the streams you have on the application, create a new stream, edit it, and delete it. This app is broken into three parts: 

- The UI that the user can see in their browser, which is made with React
- A small web server that lists all the videos you can watch
- A RTMP (Real-time messaging protocol) server that handles the video feed
